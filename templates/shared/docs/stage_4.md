# Stage 4: Self-Attack

**Agent:** `self-attacker`

1. Launch self-attacker on the theory draft + implications + theory exploration results (if available) **+ `output/stage1/negative_results.md` if it exists** (BLOCKED prototypes from prior Stage-1 rounds — orchestrator must pass this in explicitly; agent self-reads are defense-in-depth, not the primary delivery mechanism).
2. Save result to `output/stage4/self_attack_vN.md`
3. Commit: `artifact: self-attack v{N}`
4. **Triage the concerns.** Launch `triager` with: input = `output/stage4/self_attack_vN.md`, output path = `output/stage4/triage_vN.md`, context = `gate-4`. Triager applies the rules (severity-≥7 defaults to `[FIX]`; downgrades require a written justification) and produces the triage file. Only `[FIX]` items feed into the theory-generator for revision; the rest are held for Stage 5 (paper-writer) or the response letter. Do not edit the triager's output — if you disagree with a classification, re-launch the triager with explicit instructions, do not silently override.
5. Commit: `artifact: concern triage v{N}`

## Gate 4: Scorer Decision

**Agents:** `scorer` + `scorer-freeform` (launched in parallel — neither sees the other's output)

1. Launch both scorers in parallel with the same inputs:
   - Theory draft: `output/stage2/theory_draft_vN.md`
<!-- THEORY_FIRST_START -->
   - Math audit (structured): `output/stage2/math_audit_vN.md`
   - Math audit (free-form): `output/stage2/freeform_audit_vN.md`
   - Theory exploration: `output/stage2b/exploration.md` (if available — computational verification and diagnostic plots)
<!-- THEORY_FIRST_END -->
<!-- EMPIRICAL_FIRST_START -->
   - Identification audit: `output/stage3a/identification_audit.md` (Stage 1 design + Stage 3a plan; the H3 hard requirement gates on this)
   - Empirics audit: `output/stage3a/empirics_audit.md` (the H3 hard requirement also gates on this)
   - (Math audit and theory exploration files do not exist under empirical-first; do NOT attempt to read `output/stage2/math_audit_*.md` or `output/stage2b/exploration.md`.)
<!-- EMPIRICAL_FIRST_END -->
   - Novelty check (idea): `output/stage1/novelty_check_idea.md`
   - Novelty check (theory): `output/stage2/novelty_check_vN.md`
   - **Implications with lit-check tags:** `output/stage3/implications.md` (for the SUPPORTED-cap / PUZZLE-CANDIDATE-floor rules on Surprise)
   - **Puzzle-triage report(s):** any `output/puzzle_triage/triage_pN.md` files that exist (needed for the Surprise-floor rule's measurement-quality gate on PUZZLE-CANDIDATE)
   - **Pipeline state:** pass `pivot_round` and `pivot_resolved` so the scorer knows whether a pivot fired and whether it resolved
   - Self-attack: `output/stage4/self_attack_vN.md`
<!-- THEORY_FIRST_START -->
   - **Structured scorer only, on revisions (N ≥ 2):** also pass the prior theory draft (`output/stage2/theory_draft_v{N-1}.md`) and the `## Unverified claims` section of the prior math audit (`output/stage2/math_audit_v{N-1}.md`). Do NOT pass any prior scorer output or prior score to either agent — the structured scorer scores independently; the freeform scorer is history-blind.
<!-- THEORY_FIRST_END -->
<!-- EMPIRICAL_FIRST_START -->
   - **Structured scorer only, on revisions (N ≥ 2):** also pass the prior theory draft (`output/stage2/theory_draft_v{N-1}.md`) and the prior identification + empirics audit reports if they were re-fired alongside the theory revision. (Empirical-first has no math audit's `## Unverified claims` section to read; the analogous "what was unresolved last round" content lives in the prior `output/stage3a/identification_audit.md` REVISE notes and the prior `output/stage3a/empirics_audit.md` issue list.) Do NOT pass any prior scorer output or prior score to either agent.
<!-- EMPIRICAL_FIRST_END -->
2. Save results to `output/stage4/scorer_decision_vN.md` and `output/stage4/scorer_freeform_vN.md`
3. Commit: `artifact: scorer decisions v{N} (structured + freeform)`

**Agent:** `branch-manager`

4. Launch branch-manager with:
   - Theory draft: `output/stage2/theory_draft_vN.md`
   - Both scorer outputs: `output/stage4/scorer_decision_vN.md`, `output/stage4/scorer_freeform_vN.md`
   - Full score history from `process_log/pipeline_state.json`
   - Stage 1 idea sketches: all `output/stage1/idea_sketches_r*.md` files (all rounds, not just r1)
   - Stage 1 candidate selection: `output/stage1/candidate_selection.md` (which top-K candidates were screened and why the current idea won — so branch-manager does not recommend returning to already-eliminated sketches)
   - Pipeline state: `process_log/pipeline_state.json`
   - Self-attack + triage: `output/stage4/self_attack_vN.md`, `output/stage4/triage_vN.md`
<!-- THEORY_FIRST_START -->
   - Free-form audit: `output/stage2/freeform_audit_vN.md`
<!-- THEORY_FIRST_END -->
<!-- EMPIRICAL_FIRST_START -->
   - Identification audit: `output/stage3a/identification_audit.md`; empirics audit: `output/stage3a/empirics_audit.md` (the freeform-audit equivalent under empirical-first; no `output/stage2/freeform_audit_*.md` exists)
<!-- EMPIRICAL_FIRST_END -->
   - Literature map: `output/stage0/literature_map.md`
5. Save result to `output/stage4/branch_manager_vN.md`
6. Commit: `artifact: branch-manager report v{N}`
7. Read the branch-manager report. The gate decision must be consistent with its recommendation. If you disagree, log the disagreement and your reasoning in the commit message — do not silently override. **Gate 4 is invalid without a fresh `output/stage4/branch_manager_vN.md` for the current version N. If the file does not exist or is from an earlier version, re-run branch-manager before any gate decision — no exceptions.** If §E recommends **Regenerate**, branch-manager writes `output/stage1/learnings_r{N}.md` with N = (current `regeneration_round` + 1); the orchestrator then sets `regeneration_round = N` (single increment, matching the file name), records the archived paper's best score as `archived_best_score_r{N}` in pipeline state if a paper draft exists (defined as `max(scores.values())` from `pipeline_state.json` at archive time — this is an approximate baseline since Stage 6 referee revisions can improve the paper without producing a new numeric score), and re-enters Stage 1 (see `docs/stage_1.md` "Regeneration round").

8. Read the **structured scorer** output (`scorer_decision_vN.md`). It contains two sections:
   - **Content score + content feedback**: determines the gate decision. Only substantive theory issues (new math needed, proofs to fix, mechanisms to clarify).
   - **Presentation notes**: expositional improvements (reframe abstract, soften claims, reorder sections). These do NOT affect the score or gate decision. Save them — they are forwarded to the paper-writer at Stage 5.
   Also read the **freeform scorer** output (`scorer_freeform_vN.md`) for holistic assessment; if the freeform scorer's score estimate diverges significantly (±10 points) from the structured score, note the discrepancy and factor it into the branch-manager review.
9. Use the **content score** for state-dependent escalation. **Read `target_journal_tier` from `process_log/pipeline_state.json`** to select the correct row of the table below — this field is initialized to `{{INITIAL_TIER}}` at setup but may be updated mid-run by the Stage 6 `editor` agent (Downgrade or Upgrade recommendations, see `docs/stage_6.md` "Journal-fit handling"). Do not assume the original target tier; always read the current value. The variant's tier ladder is `{{TIER_LADDER_PROSE}}`.

**Scoring is absolute** — 80 means top-5 journal quality regardless of target. The advance threshold depends on the target journal tier. Default tiers (variant-specific):

{{TIER_TABLE}}

**1st scorer evaluation** (no prior score): use band logic from the table above.

**Subsequent scorer evaluations** (has prior score): use score trajectory.

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Score ≥ advance threshold | **ADVANCE** — always, regardless of trajectory |
| Score < abandon threshold | **ABANDON** — always, regardless of trajectory |
| Delta ≥ 3 points, substantive change | **CONTINUE** — one more iteration in current band (improving, worth continuing) |
| Delta ≥ 3 points, cosmetic change only | **ESCALATE** — reframing is not progress (see "Substantive vs cosmetic delta" below) |
| Delta < 3 points | **ESCALATE** — move up one level: REVISE → MAJOR REWORK → ABANDON (plateau, not converging) |
| Score < (advance threshold + 5) on attempt 3+ | **ESCALATE** — regardless of delta. Still below the bar after two revisions suggests a ceiling. Regenerate. |

**Hard ceiling:** After 8 total scorer evaluations on same problem, escalate one level regardless of trajectory.

**Substantive vs cosmetic delta.** Branch-manager classifies the v(N)→v(N−1) diff at every Gate 4 (Section A of its report). The orchestrator uses that verdict; on COSMETIC, escalate even if Δ≥3.

- **Substantive:** new theorem/lemma/proposition with proof, new proof of a previously-conjectured claim, removed or narrowed unverified claim, new mechanism with economic content, new comparative static derived from the model, new load-bearing extension or scope condition, empirical/numerical result that changes a calibration.
- **Cosmetic** (treat as typos — fixable when wrong, but score-neutral): rewording the contribution sentence, reorganizing sections, sharper or narrower abstract framing, broader-interpretation paragraphs invoking larger phenomena without new results, label promotions or demotions (Lemma ↔ Theorem) without new content, restructuring the paper around an already-existing result (promoting a different result to the headline) without new math, renaming a variable or mechanism, additional defensive prose.

Record all content scores in `process_log/pipeline_state.json` under `"scores"` so the trajectory can be computed: `"scores": { "v1": 60, "v2": 63, "v3": 67 }`.

{{SEED_OVERRIDE_STAGE_4_GATE_4}}

10. If REVISE/REWORK: pass only the **content feedback** to the theory-generator. Do NOT pass presentation notes — those are for the paper-writer.
11. Update `process_log/pipeline_state.json` accordingly
12. Commit: `pipeline: gate 4 — scorer {DECISION} (score: {N})`
