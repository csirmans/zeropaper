# Stage 1: Idea Generation

**Agents:** `idea-generator` + `idea-reviewer` (iterating)

**Regeneration round.** A regeneration round fires when the prior theory attempt succeeded but ceilinged in the REVISE band for the current target tier (see `docs/stage_4.md` tier table — e.g., 60-79 for `top-5`, 55-74 for `top-3-fin`, 45-64 for `field`), branch-manager §E recommends Regenerate, and `regeneration_round == 0` for this problem (see `core.md` escalation table). The orchestrator increments `regeneration_round` to N *before* entering Stage 1, so when this section is read, `regeneration_round` already equals the new N — and `learnings_r{N}.md` and `paper_archive/r{N}/` use the same N (the post-increment value). On a regeneration entry:
- Pass `output/stage1/learnings_r{regeneration_round}.md` (produced by branch-manager) to **both** idea-generator and idea-reviewer alongside the lit map.
- **At step 2 below, take the explicit Regeneration short-circuit** (added at the top of step 2) — do not consult the runner-up or unused-sketch priorities; the existing portfolio is by assumption exhausted.
- Sketches must not repeat any mechanism in `stage1_candidates.sketch_name` or the learnings file's "exhausted mechanisms" list.
- **If post-Stage-5:** archive the current paper to `paper_archive/r{regeneration_round}/` before generation begins; record its best Gate 4 score as `archived_best_score_r{N}` in pipeline state (if not already written by stage_4.md). If the new attempt's eventual Gate 4 score does not strictly beat that archived value, restore the archived paper and ship it.
- **Banned in seeded mode** — the seed is the contract. Branch-manager must not recommend Regenerate on seeded runs; the escalation row in core.md guards this with "not seeded."

**How many ideas to generate:** More candidates when the pool is weaker — more failures mean more draws needed.

| Context | Ideas per round |
|---------|----------------|
| 1st time entering Stage 1 | 5 |
| Returning from a failed theory (scorer MAJOR REWORK/ABANDON) | 10 |
| Returning from a problem-level failure (Stage 0 re-run) | 10, and explicitly explore different territory |

1. Read `output/stage0/problem_statement.md`, `output/stage0/literature_map.md`, and `output/data_inventory.md`
2. **Regeneration short-circuit:** if `regeneration_round` was just incremented for this re-entry (per the "Regeneration round" section above), skip the priority list below entirely — proceed directly to step 3, launching idea-generator with the learnings file. The runner-up / unused-sketch priorities do not apply on a regeneration entry.

   Otherwise — **if returning from a failed attempt:** first reread all `output/stage1/idea_sketches_r*.md` files AND `pipeline_state.json:stage1_candidates` (which records every sketch previously screened at Gates 1b/1c along with its verdict). **Seeded-mode note:** in seeded mode this step does not apply — the orchestrator never re-nominates a different idea (the seeded-mode overrides at Gate 4 and puzzle-triage block Stage 1 re-entry for idea swapping). The re-entry logic below applies only to non-seeded runs. Selection priority on re-entry:
   1. **Pre-screened runner-up** — an entry with `eliminated: false AND winner: false` (a TRACTABLE survivor that lost the tiebreak in a prior Round). These are already vetted by novelty + prototype and are the strongest fallback. If ≥1 exists, pick the highest-ranked one and **skip idea generation entirely**. To re-advance the runner-up:
      - (a) Start a new Round: increment `idea_round` in `pipeline_state.json` (the runner-up re-advance counts as a Round and is subject to the 5-round cap). Let N = new `idea_round`. Create `output/stage1/round_{N}/` and copy the runner-up's prior indexed file `output/stage1/round_{old_round}/selected_idea_{old_rank}.md` to `output/stage1/round_{N}/selected_idea_1.md` (K=1 for a runner-up re-advance). The prior Round's files remain in place as audit trail.
      - (b) Update the runner-up's `stage1_candidates` entry: set `round: N`, `rank: 1`, and reset `novelty`, `prototype`, `surprise` to `null` (they are about to be re-run). Do not touch `eliminated` or `winner` (both remain `false`).
      - (c) Proceed directly to Gates 1b/1c Step 1 with K=1. **Conservative default: always rerun both gates** — the prior verdicts may be stale (literature has advanced since they were produced, negative_results.md has grown, prototype numerics may need re-checking). The cost of one additional novelty + prototype call is trivial relative to a full Stage 2+ run on a stale verdict. Commit: `pipeline: stage 1 re-entry — runner-up re-advanced (round {N})`.
   2. **Unused sketch** — a sketch present in `idea_sketches_r*.md` but absent from `stage1_candidates` (never advanced to Gates 1b/1c). Rank by idea-review scores and advance the best as the sole candidate (K=1). Before writing any files, increment `idea_round` in `pipeline_state.json` and let N = the new `idea_round` (this Round counts toward the 5-round cap); create `output/stage1/round_{N}/`. Then continue from step 7 with K=1.
   3. **Regenerate** — only if neither above applies. Launch idea-generator for a new Round.

   Never re-nominate an entry with `eliminated: true` (KNOWN/BLOCKED) or `winner: true` (its theory already failed). Also read the previous scorer feedback and/or failed theory to understand what went wrong — instruct the idea-generator to avoid the same failure mode
3. Launch idea-generator with the problem statement, literature map, **and data inventory** to brainstorm candidate mechanisms (see table above for count)
4. **Increment `idea_round` in `pipeline_state.json`** (starts at 0; becomes 1 on first entry). Save sketches to `output/stage1/idea_sketches_rN.md` where N = the new `idea_round` value. This counter feeds the 5-round escalation cap and the dashboard.
5. Commit: `artifact: idea sketches round {N}`

## Gate 1: Idea Review

**Agent:** `idea-reviewer`

1. Launch idea-reviewer on the sketches + problem statement + literature map
2. If this is a return visit to Stage 1, also provide the previous scorer feedback so the reviewer knows what to screen against
3. Save review to `output/stage1/idea_review_rN.md`
4. Commit: `artifact: idea review round {N}`
5. Read the decision:

| Decision | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **ADVANCE** | Best idea identified. Proceed to Stage 2 with the reviewer's instructions for theory development. |
| **ITERATE** | Re-launch idea-generator with the reviewer's feedback. Max 5 rounds of iteration. |
| **REJECT ALL** | All ideas are weak. Return to Stage 0 for a different problem. |

{{SEED_OVERRIDE_STAGE_1_GATE_1_REJECT_ALL}}

6. After 5 rounds without ADVANCE, pick the top-K highest-scored ideas (up to 3, minimum 1) and advance them anyway.
7. Save each advanced idea's summary to `output/stage1/round_{N}/selected_idea_{k}.md` for k = 1..K (where K is the number of ideas idea-reviewer advanced, 1 ≤ K ≤ 3, and N is the current `idea_round`). Each file should include the development instructions for that idea plus the relevant sketch content from the round's `idea_sketches_rN.md`. The development instructions come from either:
   - **Normal ADVANCE:** the per-idea "theory-generator should focus on..." line in the idea-reviewer's ADVANCE block.
   - **Force-advance** (5 rounds with no explicit ADVANCE — step 6): synthesize development instructions for each chosen idea from that idea's `**Strengths:**` and `**Weaknesses:**` blocks in the final round's review (these are per-idea fields that always exist in a review, unlike round-level "To develop further" which may be absent or addressed to the next generator round). The synthesized instruction should be of the form: "Build on [Strengths]; the theory-generator must address [Weaknesses] during development." State in the file header that force-advance fallback was used, so Stage 2 knows the instructions are synthesized from weaknesses rather than reviewer-endorsed.

   Record the candidate list in `pipeline_state.json:stage1_candidates`. For each candidate: if an entry with the same `sketch_name` already exists (from a prior Round), **update it in place** — overwrite `round` (to the current `idea_round`) and `rank`, reset verdict fields to `null` for re-screening, keep `winner`/`eliminated` as-is (they should be false for any sketch that re-qualifies, since `eliminated: true` or `winner: true` entries are excluded at re-nomination per step 2). If no existing entry: append a new one `{round: N, rank, sketch_name, novelty: null, prototype: null, surprise: null, eliminated: false, winner: false}`.
8. Commit: `artifact: top-{K} selected ideas saved`

## Gates 1b/1c: Parallel screening on top-K candidates

**Agents:** `novelty-checker` and `idea-prototyper` (each invoked K or fewer times)

Purpose: late-bind the final idea selection. Instead of committing to idea-reviewer's #1 pick, screen the top-K advanced candidates in parallel and pick the winner based on actual novelty + tractability + surprise evidence. K is whatever idea-reviewer advanced (1 ≤ K ≤ 3).

**Seeded mode:** in seeded mode (`seeded: true` in `pipeline_state.json`), Stage 1 is typically bypassed by `seed_triage`, which populates `selected_idea_1.md` directly from the seed. When Gates 1b/1c do fire in seeded mode, K = 1 by definition and the parallel-screening structure degenerates to a single-candidate pass. The per-gate seed overrides below apply unchanged in that case. **Do not widen K beyond 1 in seeded mode** — the seed is the contract.

### Step 1: Parallel novelty check (Gate 1b)

1. Launch K `novelty-checker` agents **concurrently**, one per candidate. Each reads `output/stage1/round_{N}/selected_idea_{k}.md` (N is the current `idea_round`) + `output/stage0/literature_map.md` and saves result to `output/stage1/round_{N}/novelty_check_{k}.md`.
2. After all K return, update `pipeline_state.json:stage1_candidates` with each candidate's `novelty` verdict.
3. Commit: `pipeline: gate 1b — novelty checks {v1/v2/.../vK}` (verdicts in rank order, e.g., `NOVEL/KNOWN/INCREMENTAL`).
4. Drop any candidate with verdict KNOWN (set `eliminated: true` in its state entry). Let M = number of survivors (NOVEL or INCREMENTAL).

| Case | Action |
|------|--------|
| M = 0 (all KNOWN) | No viable ideas from this top-K. Start a new Round of Stage 1 (counts toward the 5-round cap). |
| M ≥ 1 | Proceed to Step 2. |

{{SEED_OVERRIDE_STAGE_1_GATE_1B}}

### Step 2: Parallel prototype (Gate 1c)

1. Launch M `idea-prototyper` agents **concurrently**, one per surviving candidate. Each reads its `output/stage1/round_{N}/selected_idea_{k}.md` + `output/stage0/problem_statement.md` and saves result to `output/stage1/round_{N}/idea_prototype_{k}.md`.
2. After all M return, update `pipeline_state.json:stage1_candidates` with each candidate's `prototype` verdict and `surprise` tier.
3. **Propagate Negative results sequentially** (not in parallel — serialize to avoid file-append races). For each candidate that returned BLOCKED with a "Negative result" section in its prototype, in rank order: append that section verbatim to `output/stage1/negative_results.md` (create or append), then commit `artifact: negative result from candidate {k}`. Negative results constrain all subsequent theory-generator, math-auditor, and self-attacker calls on this problem — they must be quoted into those agents' prompts and the new theory must escape them.
4. Commit: `pipeline: gate 1c — idea prototypes {v1/v2/.../vM}` (e.g., `TRACTABLE-SURPRISING/BLOCKED/TRACTABLE-OBVIOUS`).
5. Drop any BLOCKED candidate (set `eliminated: true`). Let S = number of TRACTABLE survivors.

| Case | Action |
|------|--------|
| S = 0 (all BLOCKED) | Start a new Round of Stage 1 (counts toward the 5-round cap). Negative results are already propagated and will constrain the next round. |
| S ≥ 1 | Proceed to Step 3. |

{{SEED_OVERRIDE_STAGE_1_GATE_1C}}

### Step 3: Tiebreak and canonicalization

1. Among the S TRACTABLE survivors, rank by these criteria in order (advance to the next criterion only to break a tie):
   - (a) **Novelty tier:** NOVEL > INCREMENTAL
   - (b) **Surprise tier:** SURPRISING > POTENTIALLY SURPRISING > OBVIOUS
   - (c) **idea-reviewer ADVANCE rank:** position 1 > position 2 > position 3
2. Save the tiebreak rationale to `output/stage1/candidate_selection.md` — list all K original candidates with their verdicts, note which were dropped at which step and why, and state the winner with the specific criterion that determined selection. This file is Round-scoped and each new Round overwrites it; the full cross-Round audit trail lives in `pipeline_state.json:stage1_candidates`.
3. In `pipeline_state.json:stage1_candidates`, set `winner: true` on the winning entry. Leave non-winning TRACTABLE survivors with `eliminated: false` — they passed both gates and remain valid fallback candidates on re-entry after a failed theory (this is the main operational payoff of parallel screening). Only KNOWN-at-1b and BLOCKED-at-1c entries are `eliminated: true`.
4. Copy the winner's files to the canonical top-level names Stage 2 consumes:
   - `output/stage1/round_{N}/selected_idea_{k_win}.md` → `output/stage1/selected_idea.md`
   - `output/stage1/round_{N}/novelty_check_{k_win}.md` → `output/stage1/novelty_check_idea.md`
   - `output/stage1/round_{N}/idea_prototype_{k_win}.md` → `output/stage1/idea_prototype.md`
   Keep the per-round indexed files under `round_{N}/` as well (do not delete them) — they are the audit trail for this Round's screening.
5. **INCREMENTAL forwarding:** if the winner's novelty verdict is INCREMENTAL, extract the "escape the obvious version" instruction — *"This idea was flagged INCREMENTAL — the obvious version of this model already exists in the literature. Your job is to find a result within this framework that the existing papers do not imply: a sign reversal, an unexpected threshold, a case where the standard intuition breaks. Do not formalize the obvious version."* — and include it verbatim in the Stage 2 theory-generator prompt. Gate 3 will hard-fail INCREMENTAL on the full theory, so the theory must escape incrementality during development.
6. **OBVIOUS forwarding:** if the winner's prototype verdict is TRACTABLE + OBVIOUS, instruct the theory-generator to find a non-obvious result within the model (unexpected comparative static, interaction effect, parameter regime where the sign flips). If the full theory also scores low on surprise at Gate 4, the idea will not advance.
7. Update `pipeline_state.json`.
<!-- THEORY_FIRST_START -->
8. Commit: `pipeline: stage 1 complete — winner selected from {K} candidates`.
<!-- THEORY_FIRST_END -->
<!-- EMPIRICAL_FIRST_START -->
8. **Set `pipeline_state.json:current_stage = "stage_1_identification_design"`** — this is the resume marker. The session-level resume path reads `current_stage` and routes to Step 4 below as long as it holds this value. Without setting this, an interruption between this commit and Step 4 would leave `current_stage = "stage_1"` and the orchestrator could plausibly re-run the whole tiebreak or skip to Stage 2 reading the commit message alone.
9. Commit: `pipeline: stage 1 tiebreak complete — winner selected from {K} candidates; identification design pending`. (The "stage 1 complete" commit is held until Step 4 below finishes — a resume between this commit and Step 4 must therefore re-enter Stage 1 at Step 4, not skip ahead to Stage 2; `current_stage` makes that routing automatic.)

## Step 4: Identification design (empirical-first mode)

**Agent:** `identification-designer`

In empirical-first mode the identification design is a Stage 1 deliverable, not a Stage 3a check. The selected idea names the empirical question; the identification-designer now decides how to answer it credibly. Stage 2 (mechanism mode) reads this artifact and writes a mechanism whose channel matches the design's recovered estimand.

The `identification-designer` agent body is theory-anchored by default (it expects `output/stage2/theory_v*.md` and `output/stage3/implications.md` and writes to `output/stage3a/identification_menu.md`). At Stage 1 those files do not exist yet, so the launch prompt below explicitly overrides the body's input list, output path, and "ranked menu of ≥3" convention.

1. Read the canonical idea files written in Step 3:
   - `output/stage1/selected_idea.md`
   - `output/stage1/idea_prototype.md`
   - `output/data_inventory.md`
   - `output/stage0/literature_map.md`
2. Launch `identification-designer` with the override instruction below. **Pass the quoted block verbatim** as the agent's opening message — do not paraphrase, summarize, or re-style it. The override redirects the agent's hard-coded Stage-3a defaults; paraphrasing risks losing one of the redirects (input list, output path, or single-design rule) and falling back to the body's defaults.

   > "You are operating under `--mode empirical-first` at Stage 1. **Override these defaults from your body:**
   > - **Inputs:** read `output/stage1/selected_idea.md`, `output/stage1/idea_prototype.md`, `output/data_inventory.md`, and `output/stage0/literature_map.md`. There is no theory document or implications file yet. Treat the selected idea's stated empirical question as the theoretical object to identify; treat the idea-prototyper's predicted relationship (sign, channel, population) as the substantive content the design must support.
   > - **Output path:** save to `output/stage1/identification_design.md` (NOT `output/stage3a/identification_menu.md`).
   > - **Output structure:** the paper commits to one design at this stage — produce a single primary design (using your body's per-strategy template: variation exploited, identifying assumptions, diagnostics, estimand, theory match, anticipated auditor concerns, software, references) plus a `## Alternative designs considered` section listing the top-2 alternatives with one paragraph each on why they were not selected. Do not produce a ranked menu of three.
   > - **Theory-match section:** rather than asking 'does this estimand correspond to the theoretical object?' (no theory exists yet), ask 'does this estimand correspond to the empirical question the selected idea poses?' Flag any mismatch the Stage 2 mechanism writer will need to handle.
   > - All other rules (`N/A` and `OUT-OF-SCOPE` semantics, finance scope, 2026 standards, the toolkit) apply unchanged."
3. The artifact at `output/stage1/identification_design.md` must answer:
   - Which design class (RD, IV, DiD, narrative, RCT, event study, asset-pricing test, etc.) and why
   - The named identifying assumptions and the diagnostics that defend each one
   - The estimand the design recovers, in the language of the empirical question
   - The data sources required (cross-referenced with `data_inventory.md`)
   - Top-2 alternative designs with why they were not selected
4. **Handle non-design outcomes.** If the designer returns `N/A — no causal claim` (the question is purely descriptive / calibration / model-fit despite empirical-first framing), `OUT-OF-SCOPE` (macro toolkit required), or `N/A — no design feasible from the available data variation`: do **not** route to `puzzle-triager` (its entry check requires `output/stage3/implications.md` and `output/stage3a/empirical_analysis.md`, neither of which exists yet). Instead, treat as a Stage-1 escalation:
   - Save the designer's verdict to `output/stage1/identification_design.md`.
   - Launch `branch-manager` with context = `stage-1-empirical-first-no-design`, the designer's verdict, the selected idea content, and `data_inventory.md`. Output path: `output/stage1/escalation_no_design_r{idea_round}.md`. Branch-manager (see its body's `## Stage 1 escalation report` section) produces one of three recommendations.
   - Apply the recommendation as follows:
     - **REENTER-STAGE-1**: branch-manager named a runner-up sketch. Set `current_stage = "stage_1"`. Apply the runner-up re-advance protocol in step 2 above (`Pre-screened runner-up`) using the named sketch. Commit `pipeline: stage 1 re-entry — empirical-first no-design escalation, advancing runner-up {sketch_name}`.
     - **REENTER-STAGE-0**: the data inventory is the bottleneck. Set `current_stage = "stage_0"`. Increment `problem_attempt` in `pipeline_state.json`. Stage 0 fires fresh on a new problem statement; pass branch-manager's named data-gap as a constraint to `literature-scout`. Commit `pipeline: stage 0 re-entry — empirical-first no-design escalation, data inventory bottleneck`.
     - **OPERATOR-ESCALATE**: the question is irreducibly non-causal and theory-first may be the right deployment. **Set `status = "halted_no_identification_design"`** in `pipeline_state.json` and leave `current_stage = "stage_1_identification_design"` unchanged. The session-level resume logic treats `halted_*` statuses as terminal — the orchestrator stops; auto-resume will not advance. Commit `pipeline: halted — empirical-first no-design escalation, operator intervention required`. The operator must rerun `update.sh` without `--mode empirical-first` (or with `--no-mode`) to convert the deployment to theory-first, or decide the question should be abandoned. Do not attempt the conversion mid-run.
5. Set `current_stage = "stage_2"`. Commit: `pipeline: stage 1 complete — identification design saved`.

The Stage 2 mechanism-mode `theory-generator` consumes `output/stage1/identification_design.md` directly (its body says "consult docs/stage_1.md in this deployment" — that pointer resolves here). Stage 3a's identification-designer step is skipped on first pass since the design already exists; it re-fires only if a Stage 3a re-fire on theory revision introduces a new causal claim or changes the theoretical object the empirics must identify.
