# Stage 2: Theory Development

**Agent:** `theory-generator`

1. Read `output/stage1/selected_idea.md`, `output/stage1/idea_prototype.md`, `output/stage0/problem_statement.md`, and `output/stage0/literature_map.md`
2. Choose strategy:
   - Attempt 1: develop the selected idea into a full theory, building on the prototype's derivation
   - Attempt 2+: mutate (if previous attempt had good elements) or fresh with different approach
3. Launch theory-generator with the selected idea, problem statement, literature map, **`output/stage1/negative_results.md` if it exists** (BLOCKED prototypes from prior Stage-1 rounds — orchestrator must pass this in explicitly so a regenerated or re-attempted theory cannot silently re-propose a known-blocked sketch), and strategy.
<!-- THEORY_FIRST_START -->
   Pass the same file to `math-auditor` and `self-attacker` on their launches in step 4 below and at Stage 4. On mutate / crossover / pivot relaunches, also point theory-generator at the prior `output/stage2/math_audit_v*.md` and `output/stage2/freeform_audit_v*.md` files for this attempt — the agent reads them to avoid repeating error classes flagged in earlier versions.
<!-- THEORY_FIRST_END -->
<!-- EMPIRICAL_FIRST_START -->
   Pass the negative-results file to `self-attacker` at Stage 4 too. (`math-auditor` is not launched in empirical-first mode — Gate 2 below is permanently skipped — so prior `math_audit_v*.md` / `freeform_audit_v*.md` files do not exist; theory-generator on a mutate/pivot relaunch should instead consult the most recent `referee-mechanism` report at Stage 6 and any `self_attack_v*.md` for prior content failures.)
<!-- EMPIRICAL_FIRST_END -->
4. Save result to `output/stage2/theory_draft_vN.md` where **N = `theory_version`** from `pipeline_state.json`. On a fresh `theory_attempt`, reset `theory_version` to 1. On each mutation (including re-launches after Gate 2 FAIL within the same attempt), increment `theory_version` and save to the new version file. N is a within-attempt counter — it does not reset across attempts within the same pipeline run, but it can collide across attempts; this is fine because attempts overwrite prior files and only the latest version matters downstream.
5. Commit: `artifact: theory draft v{N}`

## Gate 2: Math Audit (structured + free-form)

**Agents:** `math-auditor` then `math-auditor-freeform`

Two sequential audits — structured (step-by-step derivation check) then free-form (skeptical reader, catches conceptual issues). Both must PASS.

**Step 1: Structured audit**

1. Launch math-auditor on `output/stage2/theory_draft_vN.md`
2. Save result to `output/stage2/math_audit_vN.md`
3. Commit: `artifact: math audit v{N} — {PASS/FAIL}`
4. If FAIL:
   - Read the specific errors from the audit
   - If the auditor flagged a **load-bearing conjecture** (unproved claim that other results depend on): instruct the theory-generator to use `code/utils/codex_math/` (explore mode for proof strategies, write mode for proof attempts) before weakening the claim. Codex is an erratic genius — its output must be independently verified before incorporation.
   - Re-launch theory-generator in **mutate** mode with the draft + audit feedback
   - Keep iterating as long as the error count is decreasing (making progress). Escalate only if errors plateau or increase across two consecutive attempts — treat as theory failure, **increment `theory_attempt` AND reset `theory_version` to 1** (the next draft is `theory_draft_v1.md` under the new attempt). When launching the fresh v1 under the new attempt, still point theory-generator at the prior-attempt `output/stage2/math_audit_v*.md` and `output/stage2/freeform_audit_v*.md` files — the version counter resets but the audits do not, and recurring error classes from a failed attempt are exactly what the follow-up should avoid.
   - **After every 3rd theory version on the same attempt** (i.e., when `theory_version % 3 == 0`): launch branch-manager with the current draft, audit feedback, idea sketches, and literature map (no scorer output — sections A and score references will be empty). If it recommends restart, escalate to Stage 1 with a different sketch rather than continuing to patch.
   - **Pre-Stage-5 sketch-swap authority.** After **3 consecutive math-audit failures on the same theory** OR **any branch-manager RESTRUCTURE verdict**, the orchestrator must explicitly evaluate "swap to a different sketch from the Round 1 portfolio" on equal footing with "continue restructuring the current sketch." The never-abandon rule in `core.md` applies only from Stage 5 onward — before a paper draft exists, sketch-swap is a valid response to sustained theory failure. Record the evaluation in the commit message: name the candidate sketch(es), summarize why continuing might still work, and state the decision. Continuation must be justified by specific evidence that the alternative is worse, not by sunk cost.

5. If PASS: proceed to Step 2

**Step 2: Free-form audit**

1. Launch math-auditor-freeform on `output/stage2/theory_draft_vN.md`
2. Save result to `output/stage2/freeform_audit_vN.md`
3. Commit: `artifact: freeform audit v{N} — {PASS/FAIL}`
4. If FAIL:
   - Read the concerns from the free-form audit
   - Re-launch theory-generator in **mutate** mode with the draft + free-form audit feedback. Same as the structured-audit FAIL path above, point theory-generator at the prior `output/stage2/math_audit_v*.md` and `output/stage2/freeform_audit_v*.md` files so it can avoid recurring error classes.
   - After mutation, re-run **both** audits from Step 1 (the fix may have introduced new algebraic errors)
   - Same rule: keep iterating while progress is being made, escalate if concerns plateau or increase
5. If PASS: proceed to Gate 3

## Gate 2: Math Audit — skipped in empirical-first mode

In empirical-first mode `theory-generator` runs in **mechanism mode** and produces a prose+DAG mechanism with at most reduced-form posits — there are no structural derivations, FOCs, or equilibrium proofs. `math-auditor` and `math-auditor-freeform` have nothing to verify and are not launched.

The "audit equivalent" for a mechanism document is a freeform skeptical read covering: is the channel sharp, does the DAG match the prose, does the posit deliver the documented effect at plausible parameter values, is the mechanism consistent with the Stage 1 identification design? In v1 this read happens at Stage 6 via `referee-mechanism` (which is recalibrated for mechanism mode in phase 4 — see `templates/agents/finance_modes/empirical_first/vocab.json:_comment_pending`). The orchestrator does **not** insert a separate Gate 2 audit here.

Proceed directly from Stage 2 step 5 (theory draft committed) to Gate 3 (novelty check).

**Re-launch on revision.** When `referee-mechanism`, `self-attacker`, or `scorer` flags a content failure that requires the mechanism to be revised, re-launch `theory-generator` in **mutate** mode with the relevant report attached. The version-counter rules (`theory_version`, `theory_attempt`) and branch-manager every-3rd-version trigger from theory-first mode all carry over. Sketch-swap authority pre-Stage-5 also carries over.

## Gate 3: Novelty Check on Full Theory

**Agent:** `novelty-checker`

2nd novelty check. The idea passed at Gate 1b, but the full theory may overlap with prior work the sketch didn't reveal — novel mechanism, known result, or convergence to an existing framework.

1. Launch novelty-checker on `output/stage2/theory_draft_vN.md`
2. Save result to `output/stage2/novelty_check_vN.md`
3. If KNOWN: abandon this theory, return to Stage 2 with new approach (increment `theory_attempt`, reset `theory_version` to 1)
4. If INCREMENTAL: return to Stage 2 with novelty feedback (increment `theory_version`). Theory must deliver a result the literature doesn't already contain — scorer will hard-fail H4 on INCREMENTAL. After Gate 2 + Gate 3 pass on the reworked theory, **re-run Stage 2b (exploration) AND Stage 3 (implications) before proceeding** — the theory changed, so `implications.md` and `exploration.md` are stale.

5. If NOVEL: proceed to Stage 2b (theory exploration)
6. Commit: `artifact: novelty check v{N} — {NOVEL/INCREMENTAL/KNOWN}`

<!-- THEORY_FIRST_START -->
## Stage 2b: Theory Exploration

**Agent:** `theory-explorer`

Computational exploration — implement the key result, check at calibration, explore parameter space, produce diagnostic plots. Catches results that are correct but quantitatively zero, conditions that fail at calibration, and knife-edge assumptions.

1. Launch `theory-explorer` on the theory draft + math audit results + data inventory.
2. The agent implements the key result computationally, checks it at calibration, explores the parameter space, verifies necessary conditions, and produces diagnostic plots.
3. Save to `output/stage2b/exploration.md`, code to `code/explore/`, figures to `output/stage2b/figures/`.
4. Read the verdict:
   - If main result **holds at calibration and is quantitatively meaningful**: proceed.
   - If result **doesn't hold** or the solver/script **failed** at calibration: launch `debugger` on the failure report before concluding. Debugger diagnoses whether the failure reflects tool-fit (wrong equilibrium concept, wrong indifference conditions, sparse seed grid, etc.) or a genuine substantive failure. Only after debugger returns `SUBSTANTIVE-FAILURE` should you return to Stage 2 with the result — and even then, the theory-generator should be told "the claim doesn't hold at these parameters," not "rescope the result away." If debugger returns `TOOL-FIT-ISSUE` with a proposed fix, apply the fix and re-run theory-explorer before concluding.
   - If result is **fragile** (holds only in a narrow parameter region): flag for the scorer. Proceed but the paper should be honest about this.
5. **Re-run on substantive revision.** If the theory revises after the first Stage 2b pass — new propositions, new sections, new extensions, or any content not explored in the prior pass — re-invoke theory-explorer on the new content before Gate 4 advances. Save targeted re-runs to `output/stage2b/exploration_vN.md` (where N is the theory version); do not overwrite the original `exploration.md`. Combined coverage must span the version that will be written into the paper. On completion, set `pipeline_state.json:stage2b_theory_version` to the current `theory_version`. Gate 4 must not advance while `stage2b_theory_version < theory_version`.

## Stage 2b: Theory Exploration — skipped in empirical-first mode

The mechanism document has no equilibrium objects to compute, no parameter space to grid-search, and no diagnostic plots that aren't already produced by the empirical analysis at Stage 3a. `theory-explorer` is not launched.

The empirical-first analogue of "does the result hold at calibration?" is the sanity check rule already inside the mechanism body: the mechanism's reduced-form posit must produce a predicted effect magnitude that matches the documented coefficient in `output/stage3a/empirical_analysis.md`. That check is in-body in `theory-generator` mechanism mode, and the body itself qualifies it for first-launch vs. mutate/pivot — at first launch the empirical results may not exist yet, in which case the mechanism states predicted magnitudes from literature/calibration that downstream Stage 3a will test; on a mutate or pivot re-launch (post-Stage-3a), the documented coefficients are the binding comparison. The Gate-4-blocking `stage2b_theory_version` rule from theory-first mode does not apply here; the analogous Gate 4 rule under empirical-first is `stage3a_theory_version == theory_version` (see `docs/stage_3a_empirical.md` "Gate 4 enforcement").

**On Gate 3 INCREMENTAL re-work:** the unguarded INCREMENTAL routing instruction earlier in this file says "re-run Stage 2b (exploration) AND Stage 3 (implications)." Under empirical-first, **skip the Stage 2b re-run** (already permanently skipped per this section) and re-run only Gate 3 + Stage 3 + Stage 3a. The theory-version increment + `stage3a_theory_version` re-fire trigger handles the empirics side.

Proceed directly from Gate 3 (novelty check on the mechanism) to Stage 3 (implications).
