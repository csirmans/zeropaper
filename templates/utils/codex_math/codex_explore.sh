# Ask Codex (gpt-5.5) to explore a mathematical conjecture or question.
# Codex investigates rigorously: proves, disproves, or characterizes.
#
# Usage:
#   codex_explore.sh <question> [context_file] [reasoning_effort] [output_dir]
#
# Examples:
#   codex_explore.sh "Does rational inattention produce isoelastic demand?"
#   codex_explore.sh "What taste-shock distributions give logit demand?" setup.tex high
#   codex_explore.sh "Is log-concavity sufficient for approximate isoelasticity?"
#
# context_file: optional file to include as context (definitions, notation)
# reasoning_effort: low | medium (default) | high
# output_dir: where to save results (default: ./output/codex_explorations)

PROMPT="You are a mathematician investigating a conjecture for a top economics journal. Be extremely rigorous.

For each claim:
- If you can prove it, write a complete proof. Show every algebraic step. State where each assumption is used.
- If you can disprove it, give a concrete counterexample with specific parameter values. Verify the counterexample numerically.
- If you cannot resolve it, state precisely what you can prove (sufficient conditions, special cases) and what remains open.

Try multiple proof strategies if the first one fails. Do not give up after one approach.
Show all intermediate steps. Write in LaTeX where appropriate.
Do not hand-wave. 'It can be shown that' is not acceptable — show it."
