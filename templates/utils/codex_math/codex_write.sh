# Ask Codex (gpt-5.5) to write a mathematical proof or derivation.
# Accepts either a theorem statement from a file or inline text.
#
# Usage:
#   codex_write.sh <input> [reasoning_effort] [output_dir]
#
# <input> can be:
#   - A file path: reads the file as the theorem statement
#   - A file:lines spec: reads those lines
#   - Inline text (quoted): used directly as the theorem statement
#
# Examples:
#   codex_write.sh "Prove: if H'' ≈ 0 on [a,b] then demand is approximately isoelastic"
#   codex_write.sh theorem_statement.tex high
#   codex_write.sh paper/model.tex:200-210 high ./proofs
#
# reasoning_effort: low | medium (default) | high
# output_dir: where to save results (default: ./output/codex_proofs)

    "You are a mathematician writing a proof for a top economics journal. Write a complete, publication-ready proof.

Show every algebraic step. Do not skip intermediate calculations. Use standard LaTeX environments (\begin{proof}...\end{proof}).

Be extremely rigorous:
- Re-derive every equation — do not assert 'by standard arguments' without showing the argument
- Justify differentiating under integrals (state DCT conditions, verify Fubini applicability)
- Check boundary cases explicitly (parameters at 0, 1, infinity)
- State exactly where each assumption is used in the proof
- If a step requires a lemma, state and prove the lemma before using it
- Verify second-order conditions when claiming optima
- If the proof attempt fails or requires additional assumptions, say so explicitly rather than hand-waving
