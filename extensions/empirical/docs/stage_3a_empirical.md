# Stage 3a: Empirical Analysis

This file covers two sub-stages: **Gate 3a-feasibility** (empirical feasibility, runs *before* Stage 3 implications) and **Stage 3a** (full empirical analysis, runs *after* Stage 3 implications). In `pipeline_state.json`, use `"stage_3a_feasibility"` during feasibility and `"stage_3a"` during full analysis.

## Preflight: data-source liveness (before any `empiricist` launch in this stage)

`start_services.sh` ran once at session start and produced `output/data_inventory.md`, but a long Stage 2 iteration may have outlived the WRDS session. Before each `empiricist` launch in this stage (Gate 3a-feasibility, Stage 3a plan, Stage 3a execute, and any re-fire), the orchestrator must verify the WRDS server is still reachable:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=code python3 -c "from utils.wrds_client import wrds_ping; exit(0 if wrds_ping() else 1)"
```

If the ping returns False, attempt one restart with `bash code/utils/start_services.sh`. If that also fails, halt the stage by setting `pipeline_state.json:status = "halted_wrds_unreachable"` rather than launching the empiricist into a stack of failed queries — re-run when access is restored. This preflight is cheap (sub-second when healthy) and prevents the most common silent stall in empirical runs. The same rule applies to the FIX-EMPIRICS empiricist re-launch in `docs/stage_puzzle_triage.md`, the Stage 6 Reject re-fire in `docs/stage_6.md` (which routes through this stage's "Re-fire on theory revision" section), and any future empiricist launch site.

## Gate 3a-feasibility: Empirical Feasibility (falsify-first)

Quick falsification check: can this theory be calibrated at all? Do the key empirical moments exist? A theory that predicts the wrong sign on a well-measured moment is dead regardless of how elegant the implications are. Check this BEFORE investing in implications.

1. Launch `empiricist` with a focused instruction: "Quick feasibility check only — download the 2-3 key moments this theory needs to match. Report whether the theory's predictions are in the right ballpark. Do NOT run a full analysis."
2. Save to `output/stage3a/empirical_feasibility.md`
3. If the key moments contradict the theory (wrong sign, off by an order of magnitude): flag as **FALSIFIED** — increment `theory_attempt` and reset `theory_version` to 1, then return to Stage 1 for a new idea (the theory is dead; counter must advance so the "5 theories on same problem → Stage 0" escalation rule in core.md fires correctly). Don't waste time on implications for a theory the data already rejects.

4. If moments are roughly consistent or unavailable: proceed to Stage 3.
5. Commit: `artifact: empirical feasibility — {OK/FALSIFIED}`

## Stage 3a: Full Empirical Analysis

This is the full empirical analysis — deeper than the feasibility check at Gate 3a-feasibility. Now that implications are developed, the empiricist can design proper tests, calibrations, and portfolio sorts.

1. **Identification design.**
<!-- THEORY_FIRST_START -->
   Always launch `identification-designer` with the theory, implications, and data inventory — the orchestrator does not pre-judge whether the work will make a causal claim. The designer is the single authority on that question and records its decision as a formal artifact at `output/stage3a/identification_menu.md`, one of:
   - A ranked menu of candidate identification strategies (each with assumptions, diagnostics, estimand, theory-match analysis, anticipated auditor concerns, and software references) when the theory implies one or more causal claims that are testable from the data.
   - `N/A — no causal claim` with a one-paragraph explanation when the empirical work this theory needs is purely calibration, descriptive moment-matching, or model-fit comparison.
   - `OUT-OF-SCOPE` with a macro-variant recommendation when the question requires a macro identification toolkit (SVAR, sign restrictions, narrative shocks, calibrated DSGE-as-identification — currently unsupported, see `LIMITATIONS.md` and issue #18).

   On `N/A`: record the menu artifact and skip step 3 (the identification audit). The downstream empiricist still writes a plan in step 2; that plan must be consistent with the no-causal-claim record (calibration / descriptive / fit only). On `OUT-OF-SCOPE`: either reframe the empirical work as descriptive / model-fit (which would have produced `N/A` had the theory been written that way), or escalate.
<!-- THEORY_FIRST_END -->
<!-- EMPIRICAL_FIRST_START -->
   In empirical-first mode the design was produced at Stage 1 (see `docs/stage_1.md` Step 4) and lives at `output/stage1/identification_design.md`. On first pass through Stage 3a, **do not relaunch `identification-designer`** — copy the Stage 1 artifact to `output/stage3a/identification_menu.md` so downstream agents (`empiricist` step 2, `identification-auditor` step 3, `stage_puzzle_triage.md` references) keep their existing canonical-path expectations. Then proceed to step 2.

   Re-launch `identification-designer` only when the "Re-fire on theory revision" trigger conditions apply (the revised mechanism introduces a new causal claim or changes the theoretical object the empirics must identify). On a re-fire, the new menu may overwrite the Stage 1 artifact or be saved to `output/stage3a/identification_menu_vN.md` — at minimum the canonical `output/stage3a/identification_menu.md` must reflect the binding design.

   `N/A` and `OUT-OF-SCOPE` outcomes are not expected in empirical-first mode (the Stage 1 designer would have escalated rather than producing a non-causal artifact); if either appears at re-fire time, route to puzzle-triager to decide between HONEST-NULL and BACK-TO-IDEA.
<!-- EMPIRICAL_FIRST_END -->
2. **Analysis plan.** Launch `empiricist` with instruction: "Write an analysis plan only — do not execute yet." The empiricist reads the theory, implications, data inventory, feasibility results, and (if produced) `identification_menu.md`. If a menu exists, the plan must select a strategy from it or explicitly justify departing from the menu. The empiricist then writes `output/stage3a/empirical_plan.md` describing: what tests to run, what data sources to use (and WHY those sources — reference the data inventory), what the expected results look like, and what would constitute support vs. rejection of the theory. The plan MUST include a **proxy–theory mapping** section: for each empirical proxy, state (a) which theoretical object it is standing in for, (b) which sub-class / mechanism / scope condition it captures (if the theory has heterogeneous agent types, scope-conditional predictions, or multiple mechanisms), (c) whether the proxy construction is mechanically correlated with the theoretical object (e.g., HHI as proxy for concentration-driven noise variance is mechanical; tracking-error is not), and (d) a non-mechanical alternative proxy. If the theory has multiple sub-classes, the plan must include **at least one proxy per sub-class in the primary analysis** — not deferred to robustness. If the main proxy is mechanically correlated with its theoretical object, the non-mechanical alternative is mandatory in the primary analysis as well.
3. **Identification audit.** If step 1's designer artifact is a strategy menu (not `N/A` and not `OUT-OF-SCOPE`), launch `identification-auditor` on `empirical_plan.md`. The auditor returns PASS / REVISE / FAIL with severity-ranked named failure modes (e.g., `TWFE-staggered-no-robust-estimator`, `weak-iv-stockyogo-misuse`, `no-rd-manipulation-test`) and an estimand-vs-theory match analysis. Saves to `output/stage3a/identification_audit.md`. (The auditor also has a self-check that returns PASS-N/A if the empiricist's plan turns out to make no causal claim despite the designer producing a menu — this is a safety net for cases where the empiricist scoped down between step 1 and step 2; the designer remains the canonical decider.)
   - If **PASS**: proceed to step 4 (orchestrator plan review).
   - If **PASS-N/A** (auditor safety-net — empiricist scoped down to a non-causal plan despite the designer issuing a menu): proceed as if PASS for routing purposes; the designer's menu remains the canonical record of what the theory implied identification-wise, and the auditor's PASS-N/A flags that the executed plan ended up narrower. The orchestrator should re-read the plan in step 4 and verify it is genuinely non-causal (the empiricist's plan, not the auditor's read, is binding); if any causal claim sneaks back into the plan after this verdict, kick it back to the empiricist for a plan that is consistent with the auditor's read.
   - If **REVISE**: re-launch `empiricist` with the audit's failure-mode list and severity-7+ fixes. The empiricist revises the plan in place. Re-run the auditor. **Increment `pipeline_state.json:identification_plan_revision_round`** on each REVISE → re-plan cycle. **Hard cap: 3 plan-revision rounds.** If `identification_plan_revision_round >= 3` and the auditor still returns REVISE, treat as FAIL. Reset the counter to 0 on PASS, on FAIL routing to a different strategy from the menu, or on Stage 3a re-fire entry per "Re-fire on theory revision."
   - If **FAIL**: the chosen design class cannot identify the theoretical object from this data. Reset `identification_plan_revision_round` to 0. Re-launch `empiricist` with the auditor's verdict and the designer's full menu, instructing the empiricist to select a different strategy. If all strategies in the menu have been exhausted or the designer returned `N/A — no design feasible`, treat the prediction as untestable from available data: either reframe the empirical work as descriptive / calibration / model-fit (re-enter at step 1; the next pass returns `N/A` from the designer and skips step 3) OR route through puzzle-triager (`docs/stage_puzzle_triage.md`) — the triager decides between HONEST-NULL (acknowledge the limitation in the paper) and BACK-TO-IDEA (the prediction was load-bearing and a different theory is needed).
   - If **OUT-OF-SCOPE** (macro design): see step 1 handling.
   - Skip this step entirely if step 1 returned `N/A` (no causal claim).
4. **Review the plan.** Read the plan. Check: does it use the best available data? (If WRDS is available but the plan uses only CZ portfolios, reject the plan.) Does it test what the theory actually predicts? **Does every theoretical sub-class have at least one empirical proxy in the primary analysis?** Identification soundness is already gated by step 3 — focus this review on data-choice and proxy-theory mapping concerns the auditor doesn't cover. If the plan is wrong on these dimensions, re-launch the empiricist with specific feedback.
5. **Execute.** Launch `empiricist` with the approved plan. The agent executes the plan, fetches data via skills (FRED, Ken French, Chen-Zimmerman, WRDS, EDGAR), and runs the analysis. Saves to `output/stage3a/empirical_analysis.md` and `code/empirical.py`.
6. All code must be written to files (`code/` for final, `code/tmp/` for scratch). Never run inline `python3 -c`.
7. **Empirics audit.** Launch `empirics-auditor` on the empirical analysis + code + theory draft. The auditor runs the code, verifies results, checks methodology mechanics (clustering, robust SEs, sample construction). Identification-design soundness is already gated at step 3; the empirics-auditor focuses on whether the code actually implements the audited plan.
   - If **PASS**: proceed to **puzzle-triage entry check** (next step).
   - If **FAIL**: re-launch `empiricist` with the audit feedback. Keep iterating as long as the number of issues is decreasing. **Hard cap: 5 audit-fix attempts total.** Escalate if the issue count plateaus or increases across two consecutive attempts, OR if 5 attempts have been made. Escalation treats the empirical analysis as failed for this theory version → return to Stage 2 with the audit notes as input to theory-generator (the theory may be untestable as written).
8. Commit: `artifact: empirics audit — {PASS/FAIL}`

## Puzzle-triage entry check (mandatory after empirics-auditor PASS)

Before proceeding to Stage 4, you must check whether the empirical results contradict any prediction in `output/stage3/implications.md`.

1. Read `output/stage3/implications.md` and identify which implications were tested.
2. Read `output/stage3a/empirical_analysis.md` and the auditor's verification.
3. For each tested implication: did the data contradict it (sign reversal, magnitude outside the predicted range, condition that should hold but failed)?
4. Write `output/stage3a/contradiction_check.md` with one of:
   - **NONE** — empirics confirm or are silent on every tested implication. Proceed to Stage 4.
   - **CONTRADICTIONS FOUND** — list the contradicted implications and what the data shows. **Proceed to puzzle triage** (`docs/stage_puzzle_triage.md`), not Stage 4.
5. Commit: `artifact: contradiction check — {NONE/CONTRADICTIONS FOUND}`

This step is mandatory and may not be skipped — silently jumping to Stage 4 after empirics PASS bypasses the puzzle-pivot mechanism that exists to extract value from theory-empirics disagreements.

## Re-fire on theory revision

Stage 3a is not one-shot. When the theory revises after the first 3a pass — Gate 3 INCREMENTAL rework, Gate 4 REVISE→Stage 2, Stage 6 Major Revision triggering theory-generator work, or any substantive content change — the original `empirical_analysis.md` becomes stale relative to the current theory. The empiricist must re-run on the revised content before Gate 4 can advance again.

**Trigger.** Any of:
- `theory_version` advances and `stage3a_theory_version < theory_version`.
- `implications.md` is overwritten (Gate 3 INCREMENTAL rework, PIVOT, or any path that re-runs Stage 3) and the new file contains NOVEL or PUZZLE-CANDIDATE implications not present in the prior version.
- A referee identifies an empirical gap that wasn't addressed in the first 3a pass (e.g., "this prediction was deferred" or "the identification doesn't address X").
- Stage 6 Reject verdict triggers a deepen directive (see `docs/stage_6.md` Reject row): the deepen directive's empirics requirements become the focus of the re-fire.

**Procedure.**
1. If the new content introduces a new causal claim or changes the theoretical object the empirics must identify, re-launch `identification-designer` (step 1 of the first-pass procedure) so the menu reflects the revised theory; otherwise carry forward the existing `identification_menu.md`.
2. Launch `empiricist` with: the revised theory, the current `implications.md`, the prior `empirical_analysis.md` (so the agent knows what's already been tested), the (possibly refreshed) identification menu, and a focused instruction listing the specific new content to test. The empiricist updates `empirical_plan.md` (or writes a `empirical_plan_vN.md` for major changes).
3. If a causal claim is in scope, run `identification-auditor` on the revised plan (same PASS/REVISE/FAIL loop as the first pass; same 3-revision cap). PASS gates execution.
4. Save targeted re-runs to `output/stage3a/empirical_analysis_vN.md` where N is the current `theory_version`. **Do not overwrite the original `empirical_analysis.md`** — combined coverage across files must span the version that will be written into the paper.
5. Run `empirics-auditor` on the new analysis (same audit-fix loop as the first pass; same 5-attempt cap).
6. **Re-run the puzzle-triage entry check** (above) on the combined evidence — a new contradiction triggers puzzle-triage as it would on the first pass.
7. On audit PASS and contradiction-check complete, set `pipeline_state.json:stage3a_theory_version = theory_version`.

**Gate 4 enforcement.** Before any Gate 4 advance, the orchestrator must verify `stage3a_theory_version == theory_version`. Stale empirics are a hard block, parallel to the `stage2b_theory_version` rule for theory-explorer.

**Cap.** No hard cap on re-fires per problem — the constraint is the never-abandon rule plus the existing 10-round referee cap and the 8-evaluation hard ceiling. But re-fires that do not surface new evidence (auditor PASS with no new findings, no contradiction-check change) count toward the plateau-detection logic in Gate 4 (see `docs/stage_4.md`).
