"""Shared body loader for the three runtime agent assemblers.

Resolves an agent body from either a shared-bodies dir (as `{id}-core.md`)
or the variant bodies dir (as `{id}.md`), and optionally applies variant
vocabulary substitution for `{{KEY}}` placeholders.

Both `shared_bodies_dirs` and the vocab argument accept either a single path
(legacy) or a list. Lists are processed in order so a `--mode` overlay can
shadow a base shared-bodies entry per-agent (first match wins) and a vocab
overlay can override base vocab keys (later layers win on duplicates).

    The list form lets `setup.sh` pass a `--mode` overlay dir before the base
    dir on either tier:
      - Variant agent overrides (whose canonical body lives at
        `templates/agent_bodies/shared/{id}-core.md` and is composed with a
        variant vocab) live under `shared_bodies_dirs` as `{id}-core.md`.

        `templates/agent_bodies/shared/{id}.md` with no vocab composition)
        live under `bodies_dirs` as `{id}.md`.
    Both kinds can coexist in the same mode-overlay dir without colliding —
    the suffix discriminates them.

    If `vocab` is provided, every `{{KEY}}` in the loaded body is replaced by
    `vocab[KEY]`. An unresolved key raises KeyError with a pointer to the
    source file, so drift between the core body and a variant vocab is caught
    at setup time rather than silently shipping a literal `{{KEY}}` to an
